Welcome to **NLP Playground**, an interactive environment for exploring Natural Language Processing techniques. This dashboard allows users to dissect text, visualize linguistic structures, and analyze named entities in real-time.

Currently powered by **spaCy**, this project is designed to evolve into a comprehensive toolkit including NLTK, vectorization, and topic modeling experiments.

## 🚀 Features

### Current Tools (v1.0)
* **Tokenization**: Breaks raw text into linguistic units.
* **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Interactive, color-coded visualization of grammatical roles (Nouns, Verbs, etc.).
* **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Detects real-world concepts like People, Organizations, and Locations.
* **Live Metrics**: Real-time counting of tokens and POS distribution.
* **Custom UI**: Clean interface with clear/reset functionality and custom styling.

### 🗺️ Roadmap (Upcoming Experiments)
- [x] **spaCy Integration (Tokenization & NER)**
- [ ] **Text Vectorization**: Visualizing TF-IDF and Word2Vec embeddings.
- [ ] **NLTK Suite**: Sentiment analysis and text frequency distributions.
- [ ] **Topic Modeling**: Clustering documents using LDA.
- [ ] **Text Comparison**: Side-by-side analysis of different text inputs.
