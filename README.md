A comprehensive Natural Language Processing (NLP) dashboard built with **Streamlit**. This tool allows users to visualize text structure, analyze grammatical patterns, and recognize named entities in real-time.

Currently powered by **spaCy**, with plans to expand into NLTK and vectorization techniques.

## 🚀 Features

### Current Capabilities (v1.0)
* **Tokenization**: Splits text into individual linguistic units.
* **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Color-coded visualization of Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, etc.
* **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies real-world objects like People, Organizations, and Dates.
* **Metric Dashboard**: Live counts of grammatical components.
* **Custom UI**: Clean, interactive interface with clear/reset functionality.
* **JSON Export**: Download analysis results for external use.

### 🗺️ Roadmap (Upcoming)
- [x] **spaCy Integration (Tokenization & NER)**
- [ ] **Text Vectorization**: Implement TF-IDF and Word2Vec visualizations.
- [ ] **NLTK Integration**: Sentiment analysis and frequency distributions.
- [ ] **Topic Modeling**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for document clustering.
- [ ] **Comparison Mode**: Compare two different texts side-by-side.
